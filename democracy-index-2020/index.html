This covers almost the entire population of<br>the world and the vast majority of the world’s states (microstates are excluded). The Democracy Index<br>is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism, the functioning of government, political<br>participation, political culture, and civil liberties. Based on its scores on a range of indicators within<br>these categories, each country is then itself classified as one of four types of regime: “full democracy”,<br>“flawed democracy”, “hybrid regime” or “authoritarian regime”. A full methodology and explanations<br>can be found in the Appendix.<br>This is the 13th edition of the Democracy Index, which began in 2006, and it records how global<br>democracy fared in 2020. The main focus of the report is the impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19)<br>pandemic on democracy and freedom around the world. It looks at how the pandemic resulted in<br>the withdrawal of civil liberties on a massive scale and fuelled an existing trend of intolerance and<br>censorship of dissenting opinion (see page 14). The report also examines the state of US democracy<br>after a tumultuous year dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement<br>and a hotly contested presidential election (see page 42). The results by region are analysed in greater<br>detail in the section entitled “Democracy around the regions in 2020” (see page 26).<br>According to our measure of democracy, only about half (49.4%) of the world’s population live in a<br>democracy of some sort, and even fewer (8.4%) reside in a “full democracy”; this level is up from 5.7% in<br>2019, as several Asian countries have been upgraded. More than one-third of the world’s population live<br>under authoritarian rule, with a large share being in China.<br>In the 2020 Democracy Index, 75 of the 167 countries and territories covered by the model, or 44.9%<br>of the total, are considered to be democracies. The number of “full democracies” increased to 23 in<br>2020, up from 22 in 2019. The number of “flawed democracies” fell by two, to 52. Of the remaining 92<br>countries in our index, 57 are “authoritarian regimes”, up from 54 in 2019, and 35 are classified as “hybrid<br>regimes”, down from 37 in 2019. (For a full explanation of the index methodology and categories, see<br>page 56.)<br>Introduction<br>Table 1.<br>Democracy Index 2020, by regime type<br>No. of countries % of countries % of world population<br>Full democracies 23 13.8 8.4<br>Flawed democracies 52 31.1 41.0<br>Hybrid regimes 35 21.0 15.0<br>Authoritarian regimes 57 34.1 35.6<br>Note. “World” population refers to the total population of the 167 countries covered by the Index.

In 2020 its strength was further tested by the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.<br>The average global score in the 2020 Democracy Index fell from 5.44 in 2019 to 5.37. This is by far the<br>worst global score since the index was first produced in 2006. The 2020 result represents a significant<br>deterioration and came about largely—but not solely—because of government-imposed restrictions<br>on individual freedoms and civil liberties that occurred across the globe in response to the coronavirus<br>pandemic.<br>The deterioration in the global score in 2020 was driven by a decline in the average regional score<br>everywhere in the world, but by especially large falls in the “authoritarian regime”-dominated regions<br>of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa. Their scores declined by 0.10 and 0.09,<br>respectively, between 2019 and 2020. Western Europe and eastern Europe both recorded a fall in their<br>average regional scores of 0.06. The score for Asia and Australasia, the region which has made the<br>most democratic progress during the lifetime of the Democracy Index, fell by 0.05. Latin America’s<br>average score declined by 0.04 in 2020, marking the fifth consecutive year of regression for the region.<br>The average score for North America fell by only 0.01, but a bigger decline of 0.04 in the US score was<br>masked by an improvement in Canada’s score.<br>Chart 1.

Only 38 (22.6%) recorded an improvement and the other 13<br>stagnated, with their scores remaining unchanged compared with 2019. There were some impressive<br>improvements and some dramatic declines, as discussed in the “Highlights” section, with Taiwan<br>registering the biggest improvement and Mali the biggest decline. There were 11 changes of regime<br>category, seven negative and four positive. Three countries (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) moved<br>from the “flawed democracy” category to be classified as “full democracies” and one country, Albania,<br>was upgraded to a “flawed democracy” from a “hybrid regime” previously. France and Portugal<br>experienced a reversal, losing the “full democracy” status they had regained in 2019, re-joining the ranks<br>of “flawed democracies”. El Salvador and Hong Kong were relegated from the “flawed democracy”<br>classification to that of “hybrid regime”. Further down the ranking, Algeria, Burkina Faso and Mali lost<br>their status as “hybrid regimes” and are now designated as “authoritarian regimes”.<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>6 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>Democracy Index 2020 highlights<br>Pandemic dilemmas: life, death, lockdowns and liberty<br>Across the world in 2020, citizens experienced the biggest rollback of individual freedoms ever<br>undertaken by governments during peacetime (and perhaps even in wartime). The willing surrender<br>of fundamental freedoms by millions of people was perhaps one of the most remarkable occurrences<br>in an extraordinary year (see Democracy: in sickness and in health?, page 14 onwards). Most people<br>concluded, on the basis of the evidence about a new, deadly disease, that preventing a catastrophic<br>loss of life justified a temporary loss of freedom. Many critics of the lockdown approach accepted<br>that some form of social distancing was necessary to contain the spread of the disease, but they<br>failed to put forward convincing alternatives to the policy of enforced lockdowns, and the question of<br>how many deaths would be acceptable as the price of freedom was one that few lockdown sceptics<br>were prepared to answer. That does not mean that governments and media should have censored<br>lockdown sceptics: attempts to curb freedom of expression are antithetical to democratic principles.<br>The withdrawal of civil liberties, attacks on freedom of expression and the failures of democratic<br>accountability that occurred as a result of the pandemic are grave matters. This is why the scores<br>for many questions in the civil liberties category and the functioning of government category of the<br>Democracy Index were downgraded across multiple countries in 2020.<br>Asia rising: a shift eastwards in the global balance of power<br>The symbolism of Asia gaining three new “full democracies” (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) in 2020<br>and western Europe losing two (France and Portugal) was apt, as the novel coronavirus (Covid-19)<br>pandemic has accelerated the shift in the global balance of power from the West to the East. Asia lags<br>behind the West in democratic terms, having only five “full democracies”, compared with western<br>Europe’s 13, and the region also has seven “authoritarian regimes” while western Europe has none. Yet<br>the Asia region has, so far, handled the pandemic much better than virtually any other, with lower<br>infection and mortality rates and a fast economic rebound. Having learned from the experience<br>of SARS, Asian governments reacted decisively (albeit deploying coercive powers in some cases),<br>benefited from well-organised health systems and retained the confidence of their populations. By<br>contrast, European governments were slow to act, some health systems came close to collapse and<br>public trust in government declined. Europe’s handling of the pandemic was not a good advert for<br>democracy, something that authoritarian China did not fail to point out. The pandemic has highlighted<br>the widening gap between a dynamic East and a declining West and is likely to further accelerate the<br>shift in the global balance of power towards Asia.<br>US democracy under pressure from rising polarisation and declining social<br>cohesion<br>The US’s performance across several indicators changed in 2020, both for better and worse. However,<br>the negatives outweighed the positives, and the US retained its “flawed democracy” status (see page<br>42). Increased political participation was the main positive: Americans have become much more<br>engaged in politics in recent years, and several factors fuelled the continuation of this trend in 2020,<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>7 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>including the politicisation of the coronavirus pandemic, movements to address police violence and<br>racial injustice, and elections that attracted record voter turnout. The negatives include extremely low<br>levels of trust in institutions and political parties, deep dysfunction in the functioning of government,<br>increasing threats to freedom of expression, and a degree of societal polarisation that makes consensus<br>almost impossible to achieve. Social cohesion has collapsed, and consensus has evaporated on<br>fundamental issues—even the date of the country’s founding. The new president, Joe Biden, faces a<br>huge challenge in bringing together a country that is deeply divided over core values.<br>Taiwan: the year’s biggest winner<br>The star-performer in this year’s Democracy Index, measured by the change in both its score and<br>rank, is Taiwan, which was upgraded from a “flawed democracy” to a “full democracy”, after rising 20<br>places in the global ranking from 31st place to 11th (see box on page 32). In a year notable for having<br>few winners, Taiwan’s performance was spectacular. The country’s score rose by more than any<br>other country in the 2020 index. Taiwan went to the polls in January 2020, and the national elections<br>demonstrated the resilience of its democracy at a time when electoral processes, parliamentary<br>oversight and civil liberties have been backsliding globally. There was a strong voter turnout,<br>including among the younger generation, to elect the president and members of the Legislative<br>Yuan (parliament). Overall, the country seems to have concluded that a well-functioning democracy<br>represents the best means of safeguarding its future.<br>Mali and Togo the big losers in a dire year for African democracy<br>Measured by the decline in its score, Mali, in west Africa, was the worst-performing country in the 2020<br>Democracy Index, being downgraded from a “hybrid regime” to an “authoritarian regime”. Mali does not<br>have full control over its territory, and rampant insecurity precipitated a coup in August 2020 by military<br>officers aggrieved by a lack of progress against jihadist insurgents. A military junta has since established<br>a transitional government, nullifying the outcome of parliamentary elections held in March 2020, which<br>were broadly free and fair. Because of this, Mali has dropped 11 places globally, the second-biggest fall<br>in rank in Sub-Saharan Africa behind Togo, which fell 15 places, further down the ranks of “authoritarian<br>regimes”. Overall it was a terrible year for democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 31 countries were<br>downgraded, eight stagnated and only five improved their scores (see page 47). Burkina Faso, which,<br>like Mali, faces a jihadist insurgency and does not have full control of its territory, was also downgraded<br>from a “hybrid regime” to an “authoritarian regime”.<br>Western Europe loses two “full democracies”<br>In 2020 two west European countries—France and Portugal—moved from the “full democracy”<br>category to the “flawed democracy” one (see page 50). Thirteen countries in the region are now classed<br>as “full democracies” (down from 15 in 2019) and seven as “flawed democracies”, up from five in 2019.<br>Only three countries improved their scores in 2020 (Italy, Turkey and the UK) and 18 recorded a decline.<br>The most significant downwards score changes were in the category of civil liberties, for which the<br>aggregate score fell sharply, and in the functioning of government category. No country recorded an<br>increase in its overall civil liberties score, as lockdown and social-distancing measures used to combat<br>the coronavirus pandemic curtailed individual freedoms. Nevertheless, countries in western Europe<br>account for seven of the top ten places in the global democracy rankings, including the top three spots,<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>8 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>Table 2.<br>Democracy Index 2020<br>Overall score Rank I Electoral<br>process and<br>pluralism<br>II Functioning of<br>government<br>III Political<br>participation<br>IV Political<br>culture<br>V Civil liberties<br>Full democracy<br>Norway 9.81 1 10.00 9.64 10.00 10.00 9.41<br>Iceland 9.37 2 10.00 8.57 8.89 10.00 9.41<br>Sweden 9.26 3 9.58 9.29 8.33 10.00 9.12<br>New Zealand 9.25 4 10.00 8.93 8.89 8.75 9.71<br>Canada 9.24 5 9.58 8.93 8.89 9.38 9.41<br>Finland 9.20 6 10.00 8.93 8.89 8.75 9.41<br>Denmark 9.15 7 10.00 8.93 8.33 9.38 9.12<br>occupied by Norway, Iceland and Sweden.

What is certain is that the public<br>health emergency provided cover for abuses of power that have become familiar in recent years.<br>These two regions contain only three “full democracies” (all in Latin America), but they share half the<br>world’s flawed democracies (26 out of 52). Eastern Europe has always lagged behind Latin America in<br>the Democracy Index, but both regions suffer from similar flaws. A weak political culture, difficulties in<br>creating institutions aimed at safeguarding the rule of law and persistent issues with corruption create<br>a difficult habitat for democracy. The deterioration in both regions in 2020 revealed the fragility of<br>democracy in times of crisis and the willingness of governments to sacrifice civil liberties and exercise<br>unchecked authority in an emergency situation.<br>The Middle East and North Africa retains the lowest score<br>After Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa region recorded the second-biggest<br>reduction in regional average score in 2020 (see page 40), mainly because of the impact of coronavirusrelated restrictions on civil liberties. That score has declined every year since 2012, when the advances<br>that followed the onset of the pro-democracy “Arab Spring” uprising in December 2010 began to be<br>reversed. The region suffers from a concentration of absolute monarchies, authoritarian regimes<br>and the prevalence of military conflicts, and it is the lowest ranked of all the regions covered in the<br>Democracy Index, with seven countries of the 20 in the region featuring in the bottom 20 in our global<br>ranking. The few bright spots included increased political participation in Israel, as shown by the high<br>turnout in the election in 2020, despite it being the third one in two years, and tiny moves towards<br>political inclusion and transparency in the Gulf states, where authoritarianism nonetheless remains<br>entrenched.<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>9 © The Economist

Intelligence Unit’s<br>Democracy Index worsened in every single region of the world. A decade ago the cause of a similar<br>democratic recession was disaffection with governments and a collapse of trust in institutions<br>following the global economic and financial crisis. By contrast, the 2020 worldwide democratic<br>regression was largely the result of the measures taken by governments to address the public health<br>emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which has entailed the suspension<br>of the civil liberties of entire populations for prolonged periods. Across the world in 2020, citizens<br>experienced the biggest rollback of individual freedoms ever undertaken by governments during<br>peacetime (and perhaps even in wartime). The willing surrender of fundamental freedoms by millions<br>of people was perhaps one of the most remarkable occurrences in an extraordinary year.<br>“Wuhan could never happen here”—but it did<br>The main policy response of governments to the pandemic, whether they were authoritarian or<br>democratic, was to impose social distancing, quarantines and lockdown measures of greater or lesser<br>severity and of longer or shorter duration. By the end of 2020, many Western countries were entering<br>their third lockdowns as cases of the coronavirus surged again as a result of the spread of new, more<br>infectious strains. Only one year before, when the Chinese authorities locked down the city of Wuhan<br>in Hubei province in central China, the rest of the world looked on incredulously, and people said that it<br>could “never happen here”.<br>The entire population of Wuhan, home to more than 11m people, was confined to their homes and<br>the transport network was shut down. Soon, 56m people in Hubei province were placed under one of<br>the most stringent quarantine regimes in the world. As the virus spread across China’s 26 provinces,<br>the authorities imposed increasingly draconian restrictions on population movement: at the height of<br>the epidemic in China an estimated 760m people (more than half the total population) were confined<br>to their homes. The lockdown in Wuhan lasted 76 days and is widely seen to have been effective in<br>controlling transmission of the virus and preventing a much greater infection tally and death toll: early<br>Chinese modelling suggested that without containment measures the novel coronavirus could have<br>infected up to 500m people in China (or more than 35% of the Chinese population).<br>The subsequent course of the disease in China made it difficult to dispute the success of China’s<br>lockdown experiment. Yet when it began, few people outside of China thought that this draconian<br>approach could be replicated anywhere else. The consensus among the world’s democracies was<br>that systemic and cultural differences between an authoritarian system such as China’s and their own<br>democratic systems made lockdowns unthinkable. The Chinese regime, which routinely enforces<br>obedience and curbs on individual freedoms, had no qualms about exercising absolute control over<br>its population. By contrast, established democracies in Europe, Latin America and North America,<br>whose political systems are based on the principles of government by consent, individual freedom and<br>civil liberties, had serious misgivings about embracing such a draconian approach to combating the<br>coronavirus.<br>Democracy: in sickness and in health?<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>15 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>How the free world suspended freedom<br>Yet within months, countries around the world were following the Chinese template of lockdowns,<br>albeit without employing the same repressive techniques as China to contain what had by then<br>become a global pandemic. Political and cultural differences—and, in some cases, an initial belief<br>that the pandemic was a hoax—led some democracies to resist the policy of lockdowns. In the US in<br>particular, a strong culture of anti-statism and commitment to individual rights resulted in high levels of<br>popular resistance to the public health measures taken by state authorities to contain the spread of the<br>coronavirus. Yet these were differences mainly of degree rather than substance, and social distancing<br>and lockdowns became the standard approach to dealing with the public health emergency across the<br>developed world. In many emerging markets and poorer countries, lockdowns tended to be shorter<br>(but more coercive) and social distancing less restrictive, given the dependence of so many on the<br>informal economy and the state’s inability to provide a social safety net for long, if at all.<br>Across the world the pandemic led governments to take away their citizens’ freedoms and suspend<br>civil liberties. Freedom of movement was taken away as a result of border closures, international<br>travel bans, and restrictions on domestic travel and the use of public transport. Governments<br>invoked emergency powers or imposed states of emergency; dispensed with parliamentary oversight<br>and checks and balances; introduced compulsory social distancing, lockdowns, curfews and mask<br>wearing; confined people to their homes, except for limited activities; closed educational and cultural<br>establishments; cancelled or postponed elections; prohibited public protests; censured dissenting<br>voices and curtailed freedom of expression; and used the full force of the law to punish those who<br>disobeyed. This list may sound dystopian, yet this was the experience of most people in 2020.<br>Questions of life, death and liberty in a pandemic<br>Liberty, alongside equality, is essential in a democracy. The loss of liberty should not be taken lightly.<br>Even if a temporary withdrawal of freedoms is a price worth paying to save lives, liberties should not be<br>surrendered unthinkingly, and they should be restored as soon as possible. Many democratic politicians<br>were stunned by how easy it was to take away people’s liberty in 2020. The UK prime minister, Boris<br>Johnson, remarked upon the willingness of the population to surrender the “rights of freeborn<br>Englishmen” without protest.<br>Governments had expected that imposing broad restrictions would be much more difficult and<br>feared that they would face a backlash, but nothing of the sort happened in the UK or anywhere else.<br>There were some limited protests against the lockdowns, but these remained a minority pursuit. Most<br>people accepted their governments’ decisions to take away their rights and freedoms, even if they did<br>not like it and suffered greatly as a consequence. Should we conclude that people do not value liberty<br>or that it did not occur to them what was at stake?<br>It would be patronising to assume that people did not reflect on what they were giving up when<br>they accepted lockdown measures. They certainly had a long time to think about it during the first<br>year of the pandemic. Nor should we assume from the high level of public compliance with lockdown<br>measures that most people do not place a high value on freedom. Most people simply concluded, on<br>the basis of the evidence about a new, deadly disease, that preventing a catastrophic loss of life justified<br>a temporary loss of freedom.

Contrary,<br>to some initial, misguided opinion, it also proved to be much more lethal than seasonal flu. Covid-19<br>attacks the lungs and other bodily organs, causing in the worst cases pneumonia and organ failure,<br>often culminating in either death or long-term illness. Without social-distancing measures, the<br>coronavirus has an estimated reproduction rate (R rate) of three, meaning that every infected person<br>transmits the virus to three others. Transmission of the virus even by people who are asymptomatic<br>means that it is difficult to contain the spread of the disease. In its first pandemic year, Covid-19<br>killed an estimated 0.5-1% of those infected in developed Western countries (death rates varied<br>across continents). Deaths were concentrated disproportionately among the over-80s, for whom the<br>mortality rate was much higher (at up to 20%). Those with underlying health conditions, including<br>diabetes or high blood pressure, were much more at risk of death.<br>Until the rollout of effective vaccines at the start of 2021, the only means of preventing transmission<br>of the novel coronavirus were handwashing, social distancing, quarantines (combined with testing<br>and tracking systems) and lockdowns. Governments all over the world deployed these techniques to<br>control the spread of the disease, stop health systems from being overwhelmed and prevent a much<br>greater loss of life from Covid-19 (which had killed more than 2m people by mid-January 2021).<br>Most critics of the lockdown approach accepted that some form of social distancing was necessary<br>to contain the spread of the disease. There were a few efforts to put forward alternatives to the<br>policy of enforced lockdowns, but none was convincing enough to persuade any government to<br>change course. Even the Swedish authorities, who tried to pursue a different model for much of 2020,<br>eventually admitted that voluntary social distancing had not been effective and began to adopt more<br>coercive measures. The question of how many deaths would be acceptable as the price of freedom was<br>one that few lockdown sceptics were prepared to answer.

This is what is meant to happen in a democracy: we are supposed to debate<br>the pros and cons of government policies, especially ones which have such far-reaching impacts on<br>our lives. The inclination of many to want to silence discussion is unhealthy for democracy, which<br>thrives on the exchange of ideas and the clash of opinion. The eagerness with which politicians and<br>media in democracies, not to mention authoritarian states, sought to stifle debate and censor critics of<br>lockdown policies was disturbing.

Government restrictions on citizens’ civil liberties led to scoring downgrades for several<br>Democracy Index questions for almost every country in the world. In particular, the score for Q57<br>(“extent to which citizens enjoy personal freedoms”) was downgraded almost across the board. Some<br>118 countries, or 71% of the 167 countries and territories covered by the Democracy Index, had their<br>scores downgraded for Q57. Almost all the world’s democracies were penalised for curbing their<br>citizens’ freedoms: 19 out of 23 “full democracies” and 46 out 52 “flawed democracies” had their scores<br>downgraded for Q57. Some 27 of 35 countries classified as “hybrid regimes” also recorded a downgrade<br>in their score for this question. By contrast, less than half of all “authoritarian regimes”, where individual<br>freedoms are already greatly circumscribed, were downgraded. In 26 out of 57 such regimes, official<br>measures led to the withdrawal of citizens’ rights.<br>Scores for other questions in the civil liberties category of the Democracy Index were downgraded<br>as a result of government infringements of<br>other democratic rights, including Q46 covering<br>freedom of expression and protest. A total of 47<br>countries had their scores downgraded on this<br>indicator—30 democracies and 17 “hybrid” and<br>“authoritarian regimes”. Even in the developed<br>democracies there was a tendency to close down<br>dissenting voices, especially those who challenged<br>or raised concerns about lockdowns and their<br>negative impact on society. In more authoritarian<br>countries, rulers took advantage of the pandemic<br>emergency to crack down even harder on their<br>critics and opponents: 33 countries had their<br>scores downgraded for Q47 (“Is media coverage<br>robust?”; “Is there a free and open discussion<br>of public issues, with a reasonable diversity of<br>opinions?”).<br>1<br>The Democracy Index is<br>based on five categories:<br>electoral process and<br>pluralism, functioning<br>of government, political<br>participation, political<br>culture, and civil liberties.<br>Based on its scores on a<br>range of indicators within<br>these categories, each<br>country is then classified<br>as one of four types of<br>regime: “full democracy”,<br>“flawed democracy”,<br>“hybrid regime” or<br>“authoritarian regime”.<br>A full methodology and<br>explanations can be found<br>in the Appendix.<br>Chart 2.

In particular, the score for Q24<br>(“popular perceptions of the extent to which<br>citizens have free choice and control over their<br>lives”) changed for the worse in many countries.<br>This score was already at 0.5 or 0 rather than<br>1 for many countries, but in the 2020 Index it<br>was downgraded for 74 countries. The majority<br>of these downgrades occurred in democratic<br>countries: 17 “full democracies” and 32 “flawed<br>democracies were affected. In addition, 11 “hybrid<br>regimes” and 14 “authoritarian regimes” were<br>penalised on this indicator.<br>The scoring of other questions, including<br>Q15 (“Is there an effective system of checks and<br>balances on the exercise of government authority?”) and Q21 (“Is the functioning of government<br>open and transparent, with sufficient public access to information?”) was also affected by the way in<br>which governments responded to the pandemic. In many countries, including developed Western<br>democracies, the normal system of checks and balances was cast aside at the start of the crisis as<br>governments rushed through emergency legislation to give themselves extraordinary powers to<br>regulate and police society. In many cases, the drafting and passage of emergency legislation was done<br>so quickly that parliaments and other oversight bodies had little time to scrutinise it. Opposition parties<br>often failed to hold governments to account.<br>Trust in government took a hit, despite public support for lockdowns<br>Finally, the scores for some questions in the electoral process and pluralism category were affected<br>by government measures in a number of countries, especially those where elections were cancelled<br>or postponed. Q5 (“security of voters”) usually pertains to the issue of intimidation and violence but<br>acquired a new meaning during the pandemic. In some cases, where elections did go ahead, including<br>when the public health situation was not good, a perceived lack of security and safety prevented a<br>large turnout and may have had an impact on the election result. The scoring of Q25 (“confidence<br>in government”) was also influenced by the public’s perception of governments’ handling of the<br>coronavirus pandemic. In large measure, electorates in most democracies were prepared to give their<br>governments the benefit of the doubt, and there was a rally-around-the-flag effect. However, as the<br>crisis unfolded over many months, people tended to become more critical of their governments, even<br>as they continued to endorse social-distancing and lockdown policies.<br>The widespread downgrades of the scores for Q57 (“personal freedoms”), and to a lesser extent Q46<br>and Q47 (“freedom of expression and protest and diversity of opinion”), resulted in a sharp decline in<br>the average score for the civil liberties category of the Democracy Index (see chart 4).

However, despite or perhaps<br>because of the issues raised by lockdowns, popular engagement with politics edged up. Popular<br>participation in elections varied around the world, but in some cases, most notably the US, there<br>was a huge voter turnout, facilitated by the more widespread use of mail-in ballots as a result of the<br>pandemic. Elsewhere, especially in emerging-market regions and authoritarian states, there were<br>numerous protests against pandemic-related repressive measures and in response to other economic<br>and political issues. These were not on the scale of the protest wave of 2018-19, which was interrupted<br>by the pandemic in 2020, but they confirmed that the appetite for change and more democracy has not<br>abated (see Democracy around the regions in 2020, page 26 onwards).<br>Who rules, and how?

Even<br>though they were pressed for time while tackling an urgent public health catastrophe, governments<br>could have treated the public like grown-ups and asked for their consent and involvement in combating<br>the coronavirus epidemic.<br>Democracy is ultimately about an attitude towards people. Democratic systems are supposed to be<br>attuned to the needs of people through the existence of representative political parties and a culture<br>of robust debate about the issues that matter to people. The populist revolt of recent years, discussed<br>at length in recent editions of the Democracy Index, confirms that democratic institutions and the rule<br>of law alone are not enough to sustain a thriving democracy. The involvement of people in democratic<br>and accountable decision-making is a prerequisite of a truly vibrant democracy, whose ultimate goal<br>should be the creation of a community of active citizens. This demands in the first instance that the<br>people be consulted and that questions of the first order are referred to them for consideration and<br>debate. For this to happen, democracies need leadership, representative political organisations and<br>clear alternatives to choose from. If the political enterprise atrophies and becomes non-competitive, as<br>has arguably been the case in many Western democracies in recent decades, popular sovereignty will<br>mean nothing.<br>The question of how power is exercised in a democracy is a crucial one for our time. It is one that has<br>already been highlighted by the populist upsurge of the past five years.

The pandemic<br>confirmed that many rulers have<br>become used to excluding the public<br>from discussion of the pressing issues<br>of the day and showed how elite<br>governance, not popular

Three Latin American countries are classed as “full<br>democracies” (Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay), as is one African country (Mauritius). The predominance<br>of OECD countries among those ranked as “full democracies” suggests that the level of economic<br>development is a significant, if not binding, constraint on democratic development.<br>“Flawed democracies” are concentrated in eastern Europe (13), Latin America (13) and Asia (10).<br>Western Europe has seven and Sub-Saharan Africa six. Eastern Europe does not have a single “full<br>democracy”, despite the preponderance of upper-middle-income countries in the region. The absence<br>of a single “full democracy” in eastern Europe demands an explanation that takes account of the<br>region’s unique history in the 20th century under the domination of the former Soviet Union, as well<br>as of its transition to capitalism after 1989. Eastern Europe is also the region whose overall score has<br>deteriorated the most since the Democracy Index was established in 2006, recording a decline in its<br>average score of 0.40, pointing to core weaknesses in its institutions and political culture.<br>Significant democratic regressions have also occurred in western Europe, whose average score has<br>fallen by 0.31 since 2006, indicating that the democratic malaise of the past decade has been felt most<br>keenly in some of the most developed democracies in the world. North America has experienced the<br>smallest regression of all regions since we began producing the Democracy Index, but this is solely<br>thanks to a steady improvement in the score for Canada. By contrast, the score for the US has declined<br>by 0.30 since 2006, only slightly less than the deterioration recorded on average in western Europe.<br>There has also been a notable decline in Latin America since the index was first introduced, and this<br>became more pronounced in 2019-20.

These regimes took advantage of the global health emergency caused by the<br>coronavirus pandemic to persecute and crack down on dissenters and political opponents. The average<br>score for Sub-Saharan Africa fell by 0.1 between 2019 and 2020, to 4.16. This is by far the worst score<br>recorded by the region since the start of the index in 2006, when it recorded an average score of 4.24.<br>In 2020 the number of “authoritarian regimes” in the region increased to 24, more than half (55%) of the<br>44 countries in the region that are covered by the index.

The region is essentially back to where it was<br>in 2010, before the start of the Arab Spring, when it scored 3.43 in the Democracy Index. For a few<br>years it appeared that the Arab Spring, which began at the end of 2010, might herald a period of<br>political transformation analogous to that in eastern Europe in the 1990s.

As a result, more than half of the countries in the region recorded a fall in their total<br>score. However, the biggest country downgrades, for Myanmar and Hong Kong, were driven by other<br>factors, including mass voter suppression in the former and a crackdown by the authorities on dissent<br>in the latter; these factors led the two countries to fall down the global rankings by 13 and 12 positions<br>respectively.<br>Asia and Australasia is the region with the biggest divergence in scores: it includes top-scoring<br>New Zealand (9.25), which retained its 4th position in the global ranking (out of 167 countries),<br>while persistent laggard North Korea (1.08) is at the bottom of the global ranking in 167th place.

The election<br>commission announced the cancellation of the election in nine of the state’s 17 townships, citing<br>security concerns because of the continued fighting. However, while it cancelled the vote in seven<br>constituencies held by the opposition Arakan National party, the UEC allowed the poll to go ahead in<br>three of the four Rakhine constituencies held by the NLD. As a result, more than 1m ethnic-minority<br>voters in Rakhine state were disenfranchised.

The country was upgraded from a “hybrid regime”<br>to a “flawed democracy” in 2019, after finally holding an election, the first since a military coup d’état<br>in May 2014. However, several of Thailand’s scores deteriorated in 2020, including those related to the<br>treatment of the opposition and to curbs on freedom of expression. In line with its history of ruling<br>against the opposition, in February 2020 Thailand’s Constitutional Court ordered the dissolution of<br>the second-largest opposition party, the Future Forward Party (FFP), after finding it guilty of violating<br>the campaign finance law in relation to the general election in 2019. It banned the party’s leaders<br>from holding political office for ten years. The FFP was known for its vocal anti-military stance and<br>had emerged as the third-largest party on the back of support from young and urban voters. Antigovernment protests returned as student protesters demanded the dissolution of parliament, respect<br>for freedom of speech and assembly, and a new, more democratic constitution.

Over half of<br>respondents also said that they searched for political news in social or traditional media.<br>A series of high-impact national events further boosted political engagement and participation<br>in 2020. These included the politicisation of the coronavirus pandemic, large-scale movements to<br>address police violence and racial injustice, and presidential and legislative elections that the two main<br>political parties framed in existential terms. More Americans voted in the November 2020 presidential<br>election than in any other since 1900. Two months later, a record number of voters cast their ballots in<br>the consequential Georgia run-off election that determined which party would control the Senate (the<br>upper house).<br>The US also improved its score modestly in the civil liberties category, with a score of 8.53 in 2020,<br>compared with 8.24 in 2019. This corresponds to an embedding of national legislation passed in 2015,<br>banning the use of torture techniques used by the US government during the “war on terror” in the<br>early 2000s. Mr Trump and some of his appointees had at times been supportive of the use of torture,<br>including practices such as waterboarding. However, the Trump administration did not reinstate harsh<br>interrogation methods during its four-year term (at least officially), meriting an improvement in the US<br>score for this indicator.<br>Social cohesion collapses in the face of the culture wars and political<br>polarisation<br>Despite these positive developments, the US’s overall performance is held back by a number<br>of weaknesses, including extremely low levels of trust in institutions and political parties; deep<br>dysfunction in the functioning of government; increasing threats to freedom of expression; and a<br>degree of societal polarisation that makes consensus on any issue almost impossible to achieve. The<br>Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden, received a record number of votes in the presidential election,<br>defeating Mr Trump in the popular vote by a comfortable 7m votes. However, Mr Biden’s victory in the<br>Electoral College came through a string of narrow wins in key battleground states. The election also<br>delivered his party a smaller majority in the House of Representatives (the lower house) than it had<br>before. The Senate is now split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, with Mr Biden’s vicepresident, Kamala Harris, holding the tie-breaking vote. While pluralism and competing alternatives<br>are essential for a functioning democracy, differences of opinion in the US have hardened into<br>political sectarianism and institutional gridlock. This trend has long compromised the functioning of<br>government, and the US score for this category fell to a new low of 6.79 in 2020.<br>More worrying, public trust in the democratic process was dealt a further blow in 2020 by the refusal<br>of the outgoing president to accept the election result. Mr Trump and his allies continued to allege<br>voter fraud long after the election was over, without producing reasonable evidence to substantiate<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>45 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>their claims and in the face of court rulings finding against them. Through his unfounded allegations<br>and intemperate language, Mr Trump called into question the reliability of the democratic process<br>and further undermined public faith in democracy. Weeks before Mr Biden’s inauguration, a cohort<br>of Republican lawmakers used Mr Trump’s arguments in a failed attempt to block certification of the<br>election results. The legislature’s efforts to certify the results were interrupted when pro-Trump rioters<br>stormed the US Capitol Building.<br>There has been an increasing tendency in the US, as well as other countries, to challenge the result<br>of elections and referendums, and to seek to discredit the outcome by alleging external interference<br>and giving credence to conspiracy theories. This occurred after the election of Mr Trump in 2016, with<br>mass demonstrations by protesters repudiating the result, and a concerted campaign by Democrats<br>to blame the outcome of the election on Russian interference. The Democratic Party spent four years,<br>starting in 2017, seeking to delegitimise the Trump administration and to impeach the president. In<br>2020, Mr Trump and his allies in the Republican Party went further, in their refusal to concede defeat<br>and in their attempts to challenge the certification process itself.<br>The consequence of the long-running culture wars in the US and the heightened political<br>polarisation of recent years is that social cohesion has collapsed and consensus has evaporated on<br>fundamental issues, such as election outcomes, public health practices and even the date of the<br>country’s founding; the controversial 1619 Project sought to change the latter from the 1776 adoption of<br>the Declaration of Independence, as traditionally observed. An article published by the Pew Research<br>Centre in November 2020 examined the nature of polarisation in the US (“America is exceptional<br>in the nature of its political divide”, November 13th 2020). The authors pointed out, based on Pew’s<br>survey data, that supporters of Biden and Trump see the differences between them as being about<br>“core American values” and not just about politics and policies. As a result of this deepening divide<br>over values, political culture has become the weakest category for the US, with its score plummeting<br>to 6.25 in 2020, down from 7.50 in 2019. As Americans increasingly occupy two distinct and conflicting<br>realities, prospects for a short-term improvement in this score seem to be dwindling. The proliferation<br>of conspiracy theories in recent years, and the readiness of both sides of the political spectrum to<br>indulge them, is an especially worrying trend. At least a dozen candidates in the congressional elections<br>had expressed some level of support for QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory, with one candidate<br>ultimately winning a House seat.<br>The cleavage in US politics has long been amplified by the mainstream media, including the main<br>network TV channels which make no pretence of impartiality, but in 2020 social media companies<br>intervened in a way that is likely to reinforce the divisions in American society. The coronavirus<br>pandemic encouraged the big tech giants to go further than they had previously in policing content<br>that they deemed to be unacceptable. In particular, the social media platforms took steps to filter,<br>remove and censor content that questioned the lockdown policies pursued by governments or that<br>expressed scepticism about vaccines. However, the most astonishing intervention came before and<br>after the US election, when Twitter attached fact checks to president Trump’s tweets, and ultimately<br>(in January 2021) shut down his account. Facebook soon followed suit. That unelected, unaccountable<br>big tech CEOs can ban the sitting president of the US from their platforms should concern everyone<br>who believes in freedom of expression.<br>DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>46 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>Personal freedoms also declined in 2020. This was partially a result of the introduction of stay-athome orders and other measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, it also<br>reflects a rise of militarised tactics by the authorities to suppress non-violent demonstrations. One<br>example was the aggressive clearing of Lafayette Square near the White House in June 2020, when the<br>National Guard used chemical agents and other riot-control techniques to disperse a crowd before<br>the announced curfew. The demonstrators were peacefully protesting against police brutality and the<br>killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man.<br>The resilience of the constitution<br>A number of other indicators remained notably unchanged in 2020. Despite concerns about potential<br>voter intimidation and safety amid the pandemic, the presidential election was held securely, largely<br>owing to the widespread use of mail-in ballots (which also fuelled a welcome increase in voter turnout).<br>Mr Trump’s rushed appointment of a Supreme Court justice ahead of the election cast doubts on the<br>integrity of the US’s checks and balances system. Yet, the Supreme Court also rejected a lawsuit that<br>sought to reverse Mr Trump’s losses in key battleground states. Finally, despite efforts by a handful<br>of lawmakers, Congress certified Mr Biden’s election victory, paving the way for an orderly and<br>constitutionally mandated transfer of power. All this underlined the resilience of the US’s democratic<br>institutions. However, these events also raise questions about how much strain US institutions can<br>endure.<br>Corruption dulls the shine of Canada’s democracy<br>Canada continues to score highly in the 2020 Democracy Index, thanks to the country’s history of<br>stable, democratic government.

Jihadism is being fuelled by several factors, some external and<br>some specific to west Africa. The latter include power vacuums; a loss of faith in civilian authorities and<br>democratic institutions; and a sense of marginalisation, especially in remote, impoverished regions.<br>These factors are relevant across much of Sub-Saharan Africa, but jihadism has taken off particularly in<br>the Sahel.

Neither government has full control over its territory (most of Burkina Faso has become a no-go<br>zone), and rampant insecurity in Mali precipitated a coup in August 2020 by military officers aggrieved<br>by a lack of progress against insurgents. A military junta has since established a transitional government<br>in Mali, nullifying the outcome of parliamentary elections held in March 2020, which were broadly free<br>and fair. Because of this, Mali has dropped 11 places globally, the second-worst performance in SubSaharan Africa behind Togo, which fell 15 places as a result of a deeply flawed election and subsequent<br>crackdown on the opposition.<br>Elections good and bad, and ill-managed lockdowns<br>Regional deterioration was also a consequence of declining scores for many countries in the category<br>of electoral process and pluralism, with the average regional category score falling to 3.87 in 2020 (down<br>from 4.01 in 2019). Disputed elections in Tanzania and Guinea led to both countries being marked down<br>in the index for polling irregularities. However, there was a bright spot: Malawi’s constitutional court<br>overturned a presidential election held in 2019 that was widely decried as being unfair.

In Portugal, the frequency of parliamentary debates (through which the prime minister is held<br>accountable) was reduced during the pandemic. This, coupled with the lack of transparency around the<br>appointment of the president of the auditing court, led to a deterioration in the checks and balances<br>score.

However, as the crisis wore on, public disapproval of governments steadily increased over<br>the course of the year. The relationship between public approval of governments and effectiveness<br>of governments’ response to the pandemic does not appear to be strictly correlated (many other<br>factors can influence the degree of popular support for a government). For example, high approval<br>rates endured for government effectiveness in both Greece, which was perceived to have had a strong<br>response and performed well, and the Netherlands, where the official response has generally been<br>regarded as less effective than in many other countries.<br>Apart from Ireland, which held an election in February 2020, no country in the region held a general<br>election, and the crisis nature of the pandemic probably caused coalitions that may have otherwise<br>been at risk of collapse, including those in Ireland, Italy and elsewhere, to endure for longer. This has<br>had mixed effects. Polling in Italy in particular showed an increase in support for the institutions of<br>government, leading to an increase in its overall score.

However, the<br>swift imposition of restrictions on freedom of movement owing to the Covid-19 pandemic contributed<br>to a decline in a number of scores for Nordic countries, albeit from a high base. The average score for<br>the Nordic countries declined to 9.36 in 2020, down from 9.44 in 2019. The decline in scores was driven<br>by a worsening of scores in the civil liberties and functioning of government categories, similar to the<br>broader trend observed in Europe. Nevertheless, the Nordics still have the highest scores across all<br>categories, especially in functioning of government and civil liberties.

The return of a stable majority<br>government able to implement its mandate following two years of paralysis improved the electoral<br>process and pluralism score, which counteracted declines in the civil liberties and functioning of<br>government scores brought about by the strict lockdowns and short notice given to parliament for their<br>enactment. Overall, the UK’s score remained virtually identical, moving from 8.52 to 8.54.<br>Turkey recorded the biggest jump in its ranking in the region, as its global rank rose to 104th, up<br>from 110th in 2019, on the back of a substantial rise in its overall score. The improvement was broad<br>based. The score for electoral process and pluralism rose to 3.50 (up from 3.08 in 2019), stemming from<br>a stronger performance of the main opposition Republican People’s Party in opinion polls following a<br>strong showing in local elections in 2019. Survey data suggested an increased willingness of citizens to<br>participate in demonstrations and improved confidence in political parties. However, the civil liberties<br>score for Turkey, at just 2.35, remains the lowest in Western Europe by a significant margin and the<br>country is the only “hybrid regime” in the region.<br>54 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>Appendix<br>Defining and measuring democracy<br>There is no consensus on how to measure democracy. Definitions of democracy are contested, and<br>there is a lively debate on the subject. The issue is not only of academic interest. For example, although<br>democracy promotion is high on the list of US foreign-policy priorities, there is no consensus within<br>the US government as to what constitutes a democracy. As one observer put it: “The world’s only<br>superpower is rhetorically and militarily promoting a political system that remains undefined—and it is<br>staking its credibility and treasure on that pursuit,” (Horowitz, 2006, p. 114).<br>Although the terms “freedom” and “democracy” are often used interchangeably, the two are not<br>synonymous. Democracy can be seen as a set of practices and principles that institutionalise, and<br>thereby, ultimately, protect freedom. Even if a consensus on precise definitions has proved elusive,<br>most observers today would agree that, at a minimum, the fundamental features of a democracy<br>include government based on majority rule and the consent of the governed; the existence of free<br>and fair elections; the protection of minority rights; and respect for basic human rights. Democracy<br>presupposes equality before the law, due process and political pluralism. A question arises as to<br>whether reference to these basic features is sufficient for a satisfactory concept of democracy. As<br>discussed below, there is a question as to how far the definition may need to be widened.<br>Some insist that democracy is, necessarily, a dichotomous concept: a state is either democratic or<br>not. But most measures now appear to adhere to a continuous concept, with the possibility of varying<br>degrees of democracy. At present, the best-known measure is produced by the US-based Freedom<br>House organisation. The average of its indexes, on a 1 to 7 scale, of political freedom (based on 10<br>indicators) and of civil liberties (based on 15 indicators) is often taken to be a measure of democracy.<br>The Freedom House measure is available for all countries, and stretches back to the early 1970s. It<br>has been used heavily in empirical investigations of the relationship between democracy and various<br>economic and social variables. The so-called Polity Project provides, for a smaller number of countries,<br>measures of democracy and regime types, based on rather minimalist definitions, stretching back to<br>the 19th century. These have also been used in empirical work.<br>Freedom House also measures a narrower concept, that of “electoral democracy”. Democracies in<br>this minimal sense share at least one common, essential characteristic. Positions of political power<br>are filled through regular, free and fair elections between competing parties, and it is possible for an<br>incumbent government to be turned out of office through elections. Freedom House’s criteria for an<br>electoral democracy include:<br>1) A competitive, multi-party political system.<br>2) Universal adult suffrage.<br>3) Regularly contested elections conducted on the basis of secret ballots, reasonable ballot security<br>and the absence of massive voter fraud.<br>4) Significant public access of major political parties to the electorate through the media and through<br>generally open political campaigning.<br>55 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>The Freedom House definition of political freedom is more demanding (although not much) than its<br>criteria for electoral democracy—that is, it classifies more countries as electoral democracies than as<br>“free” (some “partly free” countries are also categorised as “electoral democracies”). At the end of 2015,<br>125 out of 193 states were classified as “electoral democracies”; of these, on a more stringent criterion,<br>89 states were classified as “free”. The Freedom House political-freedom measure covers the electoral<br>process and political pluralism and, to a lesser extent, the functioning of government and a few aspects<br>of participation.<br>A key difference in measures is between “thin”, or minimalist, and “thick”, or wider, concepts of<br>democracy (Coppedge, 2005). The thin concepts correspond closely to an immensely influential<br>academic definition of democracy, that of Dahl’s concept of polyarchy (Dahl, 1970). Polyarchy has eight<br>components, or institutional requirements: almost all adult citizens have the right to vote; almost<br>all adult citizens are eligible for public office; political leaders have the right to compete for votes;<br>elections are free and fair; all citizens are free to form and join political parties and other organisations;<br>all citizens are free to express themselves on all political issues; diverse sources of information<br>about politics exist and are protected by law; and government policies depend on votes and other<br>expressions of preference.<br>The Freedom House electoral democracy measure is a thin concept. Its measure of democracy<br>based on political rights and civil liberties is “thicker” than the measure of “electoral democracy”.<br>Other definitions of democracy have broadened to include aspects of society and political culture in<br>democratic societies.<br>The Economist Intelligence Unit measure<br>The Economist Intelligence Unit’s index is based on the view that measures of democracy which<br>reflect the state of political freedoms and civil liberties are not thick enough. They do not encompass<br>sufficiently, or, in some cases, at all, the features that determine how substantive democracy is.<br>Freedom is an essential component of democracy, but not, in itself, sufficient. In existing measures,<br>the elements of political participation and functioning of government are taken into account only in a<br>marginal and formal way.<br>Our Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties;<br>the functioning of government; political participation; and political culture. The five categories are<br>interrelated and form a coherent conceptual whole. The condition of holding free and fair competitive<br>elections, and satisfying related aspects of political freedom, is clearly the sine qua non of all definitions.<br>All modern definitions, except the most minimalist, also consider civil liberties to be a vital<br>component of what is often called “liberal democracy”. The principle of the protection of basic human<br>rights is widely accepted. It is embodied in constitutions throughout the world, as well as in the UN<br>Charter and international agreements such as the Helsinki Final Act (the Conference on Security and<br>Co-operation in Europe). Basic human rights include freedom of speech, expression and of the press;<br>freedom of religion; freedom of assembly and association; and the right to due judicial process. All<br>democracies are systems in which citizens freely make political decisions by majority rule. But rule<br>by the majority is not necessarily democratic. In a democracy, majority rule must be combined with<br>56 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>guarantees of individual human rights and the rights of minorities. Most measures also include aspects<br>of the minimum quality of functioning of government. If democratically-based decisions cannot be or<br>are not implemented, then the concept of democracy is not very meaningful.<br>Democracy is more than the sum of its institutions. A democratic political culture is also crucial<br>for the legitimacy, smooth functioning and, ultimately, the sustainability of democracy. A culture<br>of passivity and apathy—an obedient and docile citizenry—is not consistent with democracy. The<br>electoral process periodically divides the population into winners and losers. A successful democratic<br>political culture implies that the losing parties and their supporters accept the judgment of the voters<br>and allow for the peaceful transfer of power.<br>Participation is also a necessary component, as apathy and abstention are enemies of democracy.<br>Even measures that focus predominantly on the processes of representative, liberal democracy include<br>(albeit inadequately or insufficiently) some aspects of participation. In a democracy, government<br>is only one element in a social fabric of many and varied institutions, political organisations and<br>associations. Citizens cannot be required to take part in the political process, and they are free to<br>express their dissatisfaction by not participating. However, a healthy democracy requires the active,<br>freely chosen participation of citizens in public life. Democracies flourish when citizens are willing<br>to participate in public debate, elect representatives and join political parties. Without this broad,<br>sustaining participation, democracy begins to wither and become the preserve of small, select groups.<br>At the same time, even our thicker, more inclusive and wider measure of democracy does not<br>include other aspects—which some authors argue are also crucial components of democracy—such<br>as levels of economic and social wellbeing. Therefore, our Index respects the dominant tradition that<br>holds that a variety of social and economic outcomes can be consistent with political democracy, which<br>is a separate concept.<br>Methodology<br>The Economist Intelligence Unit’s index of democracy, on a 0 to 10 scale, is based on the ratings for 60<br>indicators, grouped into five categories: electoral process and pluralism; civil liberties; the functioning<br>of government; political participation; and political culture. Each category has a rating on a 0 to 10 scale,<br>and the overall Index is the simple average of the five category indexes.<br>The category indexes are based on the sum of the indicator scores in the category, converted to a 0<br>to 10 scale. Adjustments to the category scores are made if countries do not score a 1 in the following<br>critical areas for democracy:<br>1. Whether national elections are free and fair.<br>2. The security of voters.<br>3. The influence of foreign powers on government.<br>4. The capability of the civil service to implement policies.<br>If the scores for the first three questions are 0 (or 0.5), one point (0.5 point) is deducted from the index<br>in the relevant category (either the electoral process and pluralism or the functioning of government). If<br>the score for 4 is 0, one point is deducted from the functioning of government category index.<br>57 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>The index values are used to place countries within one of four types of regime:<br>1. Full democracies: scores greater than 8<br>2. Flawed democracies: scores greater than 6, and less than or equal to 8<br>3. Hybrid regimes: scores greater than 4, and less than or equal to 6<br>4. Authoritarian regimes: scores less than or equal to 4<br>Full democracies: Countries in which not only basic political freedoms and civil liberties are<br>respected, but which also tend to be underpinned by a political culture conducive to the flourishing of<br>democracy. The functioning of government is satisfactory. Media are independent and diverse. There<br>is an effective system of checks and balances. The judiciary is independent and judicial decisions are<br>enforced. There are only limited problems in the functioning of democracies.<br>Flawed democracies: These countries also have free and fair elections and, even if there are<br>problems (such as infringements on media freedom), basic civil liberties are respected. However,<br>there are significant weaknesses in other aspects of democracy, including problems in governance, an<br>underdeveloped political culture and low levels of political participation.<br>Hybrid regimes: Elections have substantial irregularities that often prevent them from being both<br>free and fair. Government pressure on opposition parties and candidates may be common. Serious<br>weaknesses are more prevalent than in flawed democracies—in political culture, functioning of<br>government and political participation. Corruption tends to be widespread and the rule of law is weak.<br>Civil society is weak. Typically, there is harassment of and pressure on journalists, and the judiciary is<br>not independent.<br>Authoritarian regimes: In these states, state political pluralism is absent or heavily circumscribed.<br>Many countries in this category are outright dictatorships. Some formal institutions of democracy may<br>exist, but these have little substance. Elections, if they do occur, are not free and fair. There is disregard<br>for abuses and infringements of civil liberties. Media are typically state-owned or controlled by groups<br>connected to the ruling regime. There is repression of criticism of the government and pervasive<br>censorship. There is no independent judiciary.<br>The scoring system<br>We use a combination of a dichotomous and a three-point scoring system for the 60 indicators. A<br>dichotomous 1-0 scoring system (1 for a yes and 0 for a no answer) is not without problems, but it has<br>several distinct advantages over more refined scoring scales (such as the often-used 1-5 or 1-7). For<br>many indicators, the possibility of a 0.5 score is introduced, to capture “grey areas”, where a simple yes<br>(1) or no (0) is problematic, with guidelines as to when that should be used. Consequently, for many<br>indicators there is a three-point scoring system, which represents a compromise between simple<br>dichotomous scoring and the use of finer scales.<br>The problems of 1-5 or 1-7 scoring scales are numerous. For most indicators under such systems, it is<br>extremely difficult to define meaningful and comparable criteria or guidelines for each score. This can<br>lead to arbitrary, spurious and non-comparable scorings. For example, a score of 2 for one country may<br>be scored a 3 in another, and so on. Alternatively, one expert might score an indicator for a particular<br>country in a different way to another expert. This contravenes a basic principle of measurement,<br>58 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>that of so-called reliability—the degree to which a measurement procedure produces the same<br>measurements every time, regardless of who is performing it. Two- and three-point systems do not<br>guarantee reliability, but make it more likely.<br>Second, comparability between indicator scores and aggregation into a multi-dimensional<br>index appears more valid with a two- or three-point scale for each indicator (the dimensions being<br>aggregated are similar across indicators). By contrast, with a 1-5 system, the scores are more likely to<br>mean different things across the indicators (for example, a 2 for one indicator may be more comparable<br>to a 3 or 4 for another indicator). The problems of a 1-5 or 1-7 system are magnified when attempting to<br>extend the index to many regions and countries.<br>Features of The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Index<br>Public opinion surveys<br>A crucial, differentiating aspect of our measure is that, in addition to experts’ assessments, we use,<br>where available, public-opinion surveys—mainly the World Values Survey. Indicators based on the<br>surveys predominate heavily in the political participation and political culture categories, and a few are<br>used in the civil liberties and functioning of government categories.<br>In addition to the World Values Survey, other sources that can be leveraged include the<br>Eurobarometer surveys, Gallup polls, Asian Barometer, Latin American Barometer, Afrobarometer and<br>national surveys. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing, survey results for similar<br>countries and expert assessment are used to fill in gaps.<br>Participation and voter turnout<br>After increasing for many decades, there has been a trend of decreasing voter turnout in most<br>established democracies since the 1960s. Low turnout may be due to disenchantment, but it can also<br>be a sign of contentment. Many, however, see low turnout as undesirable, and there is much debate<br>over the factors that affect turnout and how to increase it.<br>A high turnout is generally seen as evidence of the legitimacy of the current system. Contrary<br>to widespread belief, there is, in fact, a close correlation between turnout and overall measures of<br>democracy—that is, developed, consolidated democracies have, with very few exceptions, higher<br>turnouts (generally above 70%) than less established democracies.<br>The legislative and executive branches<br>The appropriate balance between these is much disputed in political theory. In our model, the clear<br>predominance of the legislature is rated positively, as there is a very strong correlation between<br>legislative dominance and measures of overall democracy.<br>59 © The Economist Intelligence Unit Limited 2021<br>APPENDIX DEMOCRACY INDEX 2020<br>IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH?<br>The model<br>I Electoral process and pluralism<br>1.
